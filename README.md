## The Riddle
**The Senate declared *Damnatio memoriae* on the artifact.**

The records were scrubbed. The traitor's name was erased from the final draft. The monument stands clean today.

But the Scribe's ink does not fade. The truth isn't in the *Status*, it's in the *Chronicles*.

> "He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past."

## Objective
Recover the lost artifact from the timeline.

1.  **Investigate the History:** The code you see here is clean, but history holds some value.
