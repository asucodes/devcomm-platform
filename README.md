## The Riddle
**The Senate declared *Damnatio memoriae* on the artifact.**

The records were scrubbed. The traitor's name was erased from the final draft. The monument stands clean today.

But the Scribe's ink does not fade. The truth isn't in the *Status*, it's in the *Chronicles*.

> "He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past."

## Objective
Recover the lost artifact from the timeline.

1.  **Investigate the History:** The code you see here is clean, but the **Commits** tell a different story.
2.  **Find the Anomaly:** Look for the specific version of reality where the `ADMIN_OVERRIDE_KEY` existed.
3.  **Decode the Artifact:** The key was scrambled (Base64) before it was deleted. Recover it and decipher the true message.
